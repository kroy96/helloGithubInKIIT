Myself, Abdul Hakeem Moidukutty, from  
Perumpilavu, Thrissur. Both my parents are retired  
teachers, I am the youngest among my siblings. I was  
schooled at Ansar English School, Perumpilavu, which is  
basically next-door and I went to school on foot. There  
are two stream-switches that had happened one of  
which was after schooling which was accidental and the other voluntary.  I was pursuing science stream and failed to attain enough marks in order  to get into a good college for any science streams, after which I got a  Bachelor’s degree in “English Language and Literature” from Mar  Dionysius College, Pazhanji. Though it wasn’t my dream to pursue a  literature course, I just did it for the sake of getting a degree. Along with  the COVID-19 pandemic came the news of change in the curriculum in M.  C. A. programme, upon further queries, I was quite satisfied with  shortened duration of the course and the opportunities which it will  present to me afterward. 
I am passionate about gaming and anything that’s related to  computers, saying tech-savvy might be a bit farfetched. I have always  wanted to be a game-tester where I could try out the new games and  get paid. I hope that pursuing this course will broaden that spectrum  and thereby help me in shedding some light in the related fields. I am  also thrilled by the fact that I’ll be stepping into a world of unknown and  will have to get through that steep learning curve to make it count,  hopefully I’ll get by. 
Being a part of video game development would be a dream come  true. 
Thanking you. 
Abdul Hakeem Moidukutty.
